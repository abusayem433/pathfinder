   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following (replace with your own values):
     ```env
     SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
     DEBUG=True
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
     ```

5. **Apply migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Populate sample data:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py populate_sample_data
   ```

7. **Run the development server:**

   - The terminal will open at the bottom of VS Code, starting in your project directory.

4. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment in the terminal:**

   - If you haven't already:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install dependencies (if not done):**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run Django commands as usual in the terminal:**

   - For example:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

7. **Recommended VS Code Extensions:**

   - Python (by Microsoft)
   - Django (by Baptiste Darthenay or similar)
   - dotenv (for .env file support)

8. **Debugging:**
   - You can set breakpoints and debug Django code using the built-in VS Code debugger. Make sure the Python extension is installed.
